# Cricket-Attax

Umm me and my brother had this way of playing with cricket attax cards which completely ignored the values written on the cards. The cards were just for show that the player was on your team, and even that didn't matter cause the entire game was luck based. It still was, and is, a very fun game seeing your favorite players get golden ducked while the bowlers hit centuries!

We used to use Alexa for the RNG between 1 and 6 (5 was wicket), but now I wanted to create a program to do that job as it seemed more realistic with weighted percentages, dot balls...maybe no balls and wides in the future but that is kinda complicated. I have a trello board for all features im gonna add based on three stages. I uploaded the files right when I finished stage 1 so maybe you will come in time to see my progress on stage 2 and 3.

## How to Use

Clone the program onto your system and run the C++ file (you can fork the repl and use that to run as it compiles and does everything). After that, all you have to do (for now) is press any key and enter to continue while it tells you how many runs was hit on that ball. After each over a timeline of the over will be displayed, and after the whole innings the program asks you if you want the whole innings' timeline. In the second innings it shows the runs to win, and the same other stuff. You can tweak the overs to how many ever you want, but for now mine is kept at 10 as it makes a short and sweet match.

**NOTE: All weights are expected to change in the future, as my brother has to help me decide them while right now he has other stuff to do**
